Case Study: Library Management System

You're tasked with designing a simple library management system. This system needs to keep track of books, library members, and the books that members have borrowed.

Requirements:

A Book class to represent a book. It should have attributes like title, author, and is_borrowed to keep track of whether it's currently borrowed or not.
A Member class to represent a library member. It should have attributes like name and borrowed_books (a list to keep track of books the member has currently borrowed).
A Library class to manage the books and members. It should include methods to add books, register members, borrow books, and return books.

Task 1: Object Oriented Design

Design the three classes: Book, Member, and Library. Implement methods to borrow and return books.

(Bonus) Task 2: List Comprehension

Implement a method in the Library class to get a list of all available books (books not currently borrowed) using list comprehension. Similarly, implement a method in the Member class to get a list of titles of all borrowed books.

Expected Output:

Demonstrate the functionality of your classes by creating a few books and members, and by borrowing and returning some books.
